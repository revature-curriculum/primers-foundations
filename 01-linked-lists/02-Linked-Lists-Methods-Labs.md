## Instructions:
You are to complete each lab below by clicking on the "REPLIT" link. We expect you to run your code and make sure each lab passes every test case successfully. Once your code passes all test cases submit your code for review (top right in Replit).

If you are facing any issues with Replit, you can clone the lab's repository into your system and attempt it in your IDE. Just click on the "Source" link to go to the GitHub page. There click on "Clone" to copy the Repository's URL that you can use to clone using git.
