# Sorting Algorithms
So you are given a new list of data. And the data is all over the place. There are large values in the middle, small values at the end, and everything that should go between scattered all over the data set. This list needs to get sorted. That is where sorting algorithms come in. 

There are many different kinds of sorting algorithms one can use. Some of which are more useful than others depending on the situation. There is Insertion, Selection, Bubble, Merge, and Quick Sort; just to name a few. Some of these algorithms swap elements as they iterate up or down, some split the list, and others shift the whole list over. 

## Bubble Sort Introduction
In this module, we will look at the simple Bubble Sort algorithm.
The main idea with Bubble Sort is to compare each element with the next in the list, swapping places if the left element is bigger than the right one. We loop through the list, doing these swaps until the list is finally ordered.
