# Technical Foundations

In software development, we deal with a lot of data on top of figuring out how to move and manipulate that data. We spend hours and sometimes days developing complicated logic to deliver and receive data from our UI. Imagine having to also think and develop data structures and algorithms from scratch, what a nightmare! That's why understanding the fundamentals are so important. Let us not reinvent the wheel and just learn what works In this course you will be exploring multiple types of data structures and algorithms commonly used in multi-level enterprise applications.

# What You'll Learn

This course begins by covering the data structure Linked List. You'll learn about what a Linked List is and the common operations performed on the data structure. You'll be implementing each operation in a test driven lab. 

After learning about and implementing Linked List, you'll learn a bit about a sorting algorithm Bubble Sort.

The important thing to pay attention to in the course is not the particular data structure but rather how you learn on your own and break a topic down so that you can practice it and feel confident talking about it.

## How to Use this Course

This course is composed of READMEs that explain the concepts. You should read each lesson and try out and play with any of the code examples. 

After reading each lesson, you will be working on a lab related to the lesson. To solve the lab you can refer back to the lesson, the reference links provided on the bottom of each lesson to learn more, or Google.

# How to Work on Labs

The labs in this course are provided interactively through Replit.com. Solving the labs via Replit.com means you don't have to worry about your local environment and can just use the web-based IDE and VM of Replit.com.
