# Technical Foundations
In software development, we deal with a lot of data on top of figuring out how to move and manipulate that data. We spend hours and sometimes days developing complicated logic to deliver and receive data from our UI. Imagine having to also think and develop data structures and algorithms from scratch, what a nightmare! That's why understanding the fundamentals are so important. Let us not reinvent the wheel and just learn what works In this course you will be exploring multiple types of data structures and algorithms commonly used in multi-level enterprise applications.
