# Technical Foundations
In software development, we deal with a lot of data and figure out how to move and manipulate that data. We spend hours and sometimes days developing complicated logic to deliver and receive data from our UI. Imagine also having to develop the data structures and algorithms from scratch to maintain all that data. What a nightmare! That's why understanding the fundamentals are so important! Let us not reinvent the wheel and learn what works. In this course, you will explore multiple **data structures**, commonly used **algorithms**, and other fudamental topics used in multi-level enterprise applications.

## How to Use this Course
This course consists of written lessons and on-hand labs that go alongside those lessons respectfully. The lessons are in-depth explanations of the concepts with diagrams to help explain those topics. There are also code snippets that you can copy and play with on your machine to get a further grasp of the lesson.  
After reading each lesson, you will be working on a lab related to the lesson. To solve the lab, you can always refer to the respective lesson. There are also reference links provided at the bottom of each lesson to learn more about the topic you have read about. Otherwise, you are more than welcome to Google about the topic.
## What You'll Learn
This course begins with lessons on the Linked List data structure. This lesson is divided into four sections: Introduction to Linked Lists, Linked List Insertion, Retrieval, and Deletion.  
Afterward, you will dive into a lesson on the Bubble Sort algorithm. This topic consists of only one section.
## How to Work on Labs
The labs in this course are provided interactively through **Replit.com**. Solving the labs via Replit.com means you don't have to worry about your local environment and can use the web-based IDE and VM of Replit.

**To access the labs via Replit.com, you must [join the Post-Training Replit Team by clicking on this hyperlink](https://replit.com/teams/join/ovnxpukpgnmqolcfnlrlxvygvzunwhgo-staging-foundations-h2-22) and signing up for a free Replit.com account with your Revature.net Email.**

**PLEASE USE YOUR REVATURE.NET EMAIL WHEN SIGNING UP FOR REPLIT OR YOUR PROGRESS WON'T BE TRACKED**

If you already have a Replit account, please log out, signup for a new one with your **Revature.net email**, and join the **Post-Training Team** with that account.

You are given access to the GitHub repository for each lab, which allows you to pull the code into your local machine. If you choose to do this instead of working on the web-based IDE, you will need to copy the work you have in your IDE and paste it into Replit to submit your work for review.
## Expectations
Assignees are expected to do this course at their own pace, keeping in mind that we determine **completion within the week that it was assigned**.  
Assignees are not allowed to use this course as an excuse to miss any other Staging/PO activities.  
Interviews will take top priority, and _may_ excuse you from completing this course.
