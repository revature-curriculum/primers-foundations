# Method Approach
We all face problems every day in our daily lives, and each problem can be solved in many different ways. The same thing goes for software development. As a developer, our job is to take a problem within a program and solve it. Depending on the developer's preference and experience, their *approach* to the problem may differ. The two that we talked about in this course are **Iterative** solutions and ***Recursive*** solutions. Each has its use case, and difficulty of implementation. 

## Iterative Solutions
An **Iterative** approach is one of the most intuitive solutions many developers come across. It is the first thing we tend to learn how to do when we are first learning to develop. It uses `for` and `while` loops to *iterate* through a process. Many of the modules in this course will teach this approach. However, most of the modules will not require you to simply confine yourself to just this approach.

In this module, we will be looking at **Recursive** solutions and how they are constructed!

## Recursion Solutions
Let's say you are developing an *Iterative* approach and the constant use of a `for` loop in the logic is becoming overwhelming in the script. This is when we might want to use a **Recursive** approach. This approach is taking a method, and calling it within itself!

"*Method inception!*" 

This should loop through your logic and, in the end, `return` the value you seek.
