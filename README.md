## How to add Labs to Replit
### In GitHub
- Create a new repository using the `Replit-Java-Starter` templete from `Revature-Curriculum`
- change the `classpath` in the `.replit` file to correspond to the class that will contain our main method.
  >If we do not change the classpath, replit will search for the main method in a `main` class instead of the class we named
- All test files should have a `.test` extension
  >Having `.java` extension on our test files could result in an error in replit. 
### In Replit 
- Create a new project and name it the same as the repository that it will correspond to.
- Once created,, delete all the pre-created files auto-generated by Replit. Do not forget to delete the **Config Files** too (click on the three dots next to the **File** heading, and click on "Show Hidden Files")
- Afterwards, go into the version control tab. There you will click on the button that says: `connect to GitHub`
- From the drop down menu that will pop-up, select the repository that the lab corresponds to.
- Once the repository is selected, click on **Pull** from lab
  >Do not click on **Connect** from lab, this will not pull the files form our repoisitory
- Once your GitHub repository is pull and you see your files in the Replit project, run the project to check for any errors.
- Now go to the test tab, the checkmark icon, here you will need to create a new test case and copy and past the test file into the body of each test cases. 
  >NOTE: the title of each @Test will be written in its own corresponding field and not in the same text box that contains the logic of the test case. The @Test method signature will update reactivly as you change it.
- Run the test once to install dependencies, and test if test cases work. 
## Project Format
The Project will have 2-3 seperate courses constructed, based on the skill level determin with an entry assessment into staging:
- **Beginners Technical Foundation Course**
- **Intermediate Technical Foundation Course**
- **Advance Technical Foundation Course**

#### Staging's Entry Assessment Plan:

## Tracking
Courses' development tracker will be done manually here: [Tech Foundation Dev Tracker.xlsx]([Tech Foundation Dev Tracker.xlsx](https://revature0.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/Products/post-training/Ef_zKNr43DFOtHunVQRd9scBSXzJjyTC6A-h2Cs7vmNsuA?e=7JfdVY))

Tracking of the associate's progress will be handled by multiple sources, all compliled into one [Power BI Report](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/b6159da8-78c9-4260-bc94-e34277cdb751/ReportSection?ctid=6b63e28a-a8f9-47b5-aa40-97e231215164).
> Sources include: RevPro, Replit, Salesforce

Tracking of associates' feedback on the course will be done through a MS Form: [Share Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=iuJja_motUeqQJfiMSFRZAYwJWleUkJLno0z5ioTLXdUNUVHOVJNR1lPWVMwOENRRzI0WkEzTDIwTy4u)
> To gather associates' perspective on the course and to see if there is a common issue or concern to address in future iteration of the course.

## Manager to Associate Interactions
#### Course Bugs and Issues
Assoicates are to report any bugs or issues they face when taking the course via the Jira ticketing system introdued to them when entering Staging.
If the issue is very common among all the assigned associates

#### Content Related Clarification and/or Further Explaination
Assoicates could request, through the Jira ticketing system, further explaination for clarification or to expand knowledge on a certain topic.
<span style= "color: red">Will need a trainer to host a short. 30 minuets, session with assoicates to explain the algorithms or data structures requested to further expand on</span>
> Not feasible at the moment
