// The purpose of this code segment is to provide test code for the search() method in BinarySearch.

public class BinaryTreeTest {

    // Place test code to do the following:
    // Initialize a BinaryTree object
    // Populate the binary tree using the addNode method
    // Count how many nodes are in the tree using the countNodes method.
    // Print PreOrder, InOrder, and PostOrder lists of the tree using the respective methods.
    // Delete a node from the tree using the deleteNode method. Then, attempt to delete the node again to demonstrate an error.
    // Print the tree using any of the desired methods after deleting a node in the previous step.
